# `Web Scraper App`

## Project Description

-  The goal of this project is to build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the NASA's website for Mars and Mars data and displays the information in a single HTML page.
- First, begin scraping the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text and assign the text to variables that can be referenced later.
- Then, visit this [url](https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html) and using splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable.
- Using the same scraping libraries, visit the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://space-facts.com/mars/) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, and other relevant data. Then, visit the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.
- Finally, using MongoDB and Flask, build an HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped/gathered from the URLs previously listed.
