> Build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Complete initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. Scrape several websites and collect relevant data. Assign the text and photos to variables that can be referenced later. Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs.
